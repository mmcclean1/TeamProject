Hi lads see for the admin stuff, im gonna work this week on the admin being able to add and remove topics!
im also gonna have the main page for the admin just showing all students who are registerd as the main page when admin logs in.
So that leaves us with:

Comments page:disappove, approve comments
Admins:add admins, remove admins.

Any other categories that you guys want to add feel free, i have few basline categories on the side bar already. Becauase you guys choose to work on older version all css might need be implemented which could take some time. i will send you guys out the latest version can you guys put your own individual work into the essential pages and send out a latest sql that you are using.Use the latest version when adding contend to the admin pages. I just put in the empty pages for you guys to work on, if any other ideas
add away. 

cheers.
